# Force cancellation - 005

- Considering that /cancel is a request by BNP for SNP to cancel an order/fulfillment, there may be a need for BNP to initiate "force cancellation" in certain cases, such as a buyer requesting cancellation due to a fulfillment TAT breach;
- May be defined by SNP:
  - Includes cancellation fee as a flat amount or percentage (% to be interpreted as follows):
    - % of order value (excluding taxes) for order cancellation;
    - % of fulfillment value (i.e., item + fulfillment-level costs excluding taxes) for fulfillment cancellation (in case of multiple fulfillments);
  - For an order with multiple fulfillments, cancellation fees may be defined as a %;
  - Can be optionally defined at:
    - Order level (in /on_init);
  - Will be applicable for cancellation of order/fulfillment only after the corresponding order state is "Accepted";
- **Cancellation terms definition**:
  - In /on_init - cancellation fee for a specific fulfillment state & reason code, with an option for a wildcard ("*") as the catch-all clause covering combinations of fulfillment state & reason code not specifically defined;
- **Cancellation fee calculation**:
  - For /on_cancel response:
    - (Order value - updated order value in /on_cancel);
  - For no /on_cancel response:
    - If matching the specific fulfillment state & reason code, the cancellation fee will be as defined in the cancellation terms for /on_init;
    - If not matching, the cancellation fee will be 0;
- **Cancellation**:
  - BNP initiates cancellation for order/fulfillment using /cancel (with reason code/fulfillment ID, as applicable);
  - Includes TAT for receiving a valid cancellation response;
  - If SNP sends a valid /on_cancel response within TAT:
    - Response has an updated quote, and the order/fulfillment state is set to "Cancelled";
    - BNP processes the response and calculates the cancellation fee as defined above;
  - If SNP doesn’t send a valid response or doesn’t respond within TAT:
    - BNP sends a force cancel request for order/fulfillment, i.e., a /cancel request with "force": "yes";
    - If SNP sends a valid response within TAT, processing will be as defined in the previous step;
    - If SNP doesn’t send a (valid) response:
      - BNP will create an IGM issue for resolution (after expiry of TAT), including details such as the cancellation fee calculated and refund issued (as applicable);
      - Resolution of the IGM issue will create a valid /on_cancel response for the "force" cancellation;
